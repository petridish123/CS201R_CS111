## A bunch of random stuff I can't identify
Yeah there's a bunch of columns named "___ Unposted Current Score" and stuff like that. No clue what that's about. Gonna delete those columns in my analysis ngl.

# TODOs

- All other assignments were due before the final.
- Figure out what those weird columns mean.
- *Whatever else you guys wanna put here*


For data analysis, I created a testing and training set. 
# **PLEASE ONLY USE THE TRAINING SET**
As for your analysis, remove any columns you see that hinder the assessment, But I did edit the data to only have what we are going to us.
## I SUGGEST USING A REGRESSOR, NOT A CLASSIFIER
